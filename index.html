        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            At Mile Zero, we make technical product development straightforward, guiding you 
            every step toward your goals.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
        <p> 
            At Mile Zero, product engineering is a passion.  We are based in the New Orleans area
            and have spent countless hours driving across the Lake Ponchartrain Causeway Bridge.
            The drive across this 23.83 mile engineering marvel starts at Mile Zero.  This is no
            ordinary commute, and it presents a unique opportunity to be fully immersed in thought
            and planning for what comes ahead.  Every technical challenge can benefit from this same
            model: start at Mile Zero, immerse yourself in the challenge and charge ahead.
        </p>
        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>
            We specialize in end-to-end technical product development, engineering services, 
            and consulting to help you launch successful products. We empower businesses to 
            turn innovative concepts into reality with expert guidance in technical product 
            development, from idea inception to market launch.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements Development</h3>
        <p>
            Mile Zero has 10+ years of experience writing requirements for complex embedded systems 
            including marketing, systems, high level and low level design elements. We help you define 
            your product requirements, ensuring your product meets your needs and aligns with your business goals.
        </p>
        <h3>Process Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            Processes and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are the backbone of any successful organization. 
            Mile Zero has experience in developing and implementing processes for technical product engineering
            teams focusing on quality control, quality assurance and continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <h3>Team Augmentation</h3>
        <p>
            Small teams deserve the help they need to bring product visions to reality.  Mile Zero can help you set up your
            team to support joint and fully outsourced development allowing you to scale and succeed.  We have
            experience with many onshore, nearshore and offshore development partners and can greatly reduce 
            the time needed from your organization to find the right team and establish the necessary contracts
            and SOWs to get started.
