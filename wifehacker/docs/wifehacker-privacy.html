    <section>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Wife Hacker Android app distributed via Google Play.</li>
        <li>Our public website, including <code>/wifehacker/</code> and <code>/wifehacker/docs/</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the minimum data needed to operate the app and improve user experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account & Authentication</strong>: email address, authentication identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile</strong>: first/last name, partner name, optional preferences/tags, anniversary date.</li>
        <li><strong>App Content</strong>: cycle tracking inputs, logs you create, and settings you configure.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics & Performance</strong>: crash reports, device model, app version, and basic technical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: event data about feature usage and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Communications</strong>: messages you send via our contact form or email, including account deletion requests.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wife Hacker Intelligence (AI Messaging)</h2>
      <p>The optional Wife Hacker Intelligence feature lets you ask relationship questions and receive AI‑assisted responses. To make this work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encrypted message history in the cloud</strong>: We store your message history encrypted at rest and in transit to provide a secure backup and allow portability across your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>AI service provider</strong>: To generate replies, we send your prompts and necessary context to our AI provider (OpenAI) for processing. They act as our service provider to return a response; we do not sell your messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Model limitations</strong>: AI‑generated content can be incomplete, outdated, or incorrect. Treat AI responses as informational only and use your own judgment before acting on them.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Do not rely on AI responses for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. If you encounter harmful or unsafe content, please contact us.
      </div>
      <p>You can delete your AI conversation history by deleting your account (see “Your choices & rights”).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we use data</h2>

      <h2>Data sharing & disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share data only as necessary to operate the service:</p>

        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: e.g., Firebase (authentication, databases, cloud functions) and OpenAI (to process AI prompts and return responses).</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance & Safety</strong>: where required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: if the company is reorganized, merged, or sold, consistent with this Policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use industry‑standard security and require our service providers to protect personal information. We do not permit providers to use your data for their own marketing. (Note: OpenAI’s API services state that customer API data is not used to train OpenAI’s models by default.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit (TLS), enforced authentication, and least‑privilege access to production systems. No system can be 100% secure; please use a strong, unique password and keep your device up to date.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>We operate in the United States. If you access the app from other regions, your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Region‑specific disclosures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EEA/UK</strong>: Where applicable, our legal bases include performance of a contract (providing the service), legitimate interests (security, analytics), and consent (where requested). You may have rights to access, rectify, erase, or restrict processing of your data and to object to processing or request portability.</li>
        <li><strong>California</strong>: We do not sell or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. You may request deletion and access to categories of personal information we collect, and you have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>To exercise any rights, contact us via our <a href="/public/contact/index.html">Contact form</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
      <p>Our app and site may contain links to or rely on third‑party services that have their own privacy practices. These include, for example, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database, Cloud Functions), Google (Play billing, Google Sign‑In), and OpenAI (AI processing for messaging). We encourage you to review their policies.</p>

      <h2>Google Play account deletion disclosure</h2>
      <p>In accordance with Google Play policies, Wife Hacker provides a readily discoverable account deletion option both <strong>inside the app</strong> and <strong>outside the app</strong> on the web.

If limited data must be retained for security, fraud prevention, or legal reasons, we disclose those categories in this Policy and restrict retention to the minimum period necessary.</p>
